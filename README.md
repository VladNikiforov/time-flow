Focus on what matters by keeping track of your time on the web

## ‚≠ê My goals & purpose of the utility

I just want a browser extension that just does its job and nothing more - clean and minimal. No unnecessary crap like ads and subscribtions

Core Values:

- **Privacy** - fully local, your data doesn't leave your machine
- **Transparency** - free, open-source, no ads
- **Visuals** - clean UI, straight to the point

It's a hobby project and my main goal is just to make this the best it can be

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

Before submitting a pull request I want to point out some things

- If you want to submit a PR it must be tied to a specific issue, I'm not accepting random PRs with random changes
- It's good practice to run `npm run format` before submitting to format everything neatly

Thanks for understanding and helping improve the project thoughtfully!
